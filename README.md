# Jack

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jack-cli-cd-ripper/jack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jack-cli-cd-ripper/jack)

Jack is command-line CD ripper. It extracts audio from a CD, encodes it using
3rd party software and augments it with metadata from
[CDDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDDB).

As all CLI things, Jack (the ripper) is fast and efficient, and that's why we
like it.


## Usage

Rip, encode, tag and put all metadata from CDDB in the track files:

```shell
$ jack --query
```

Write, augment or fix metadata in the track files:

```shell
$ vim jack.freedb
$ jack --rename
```

Publish the augmented/fixed metadata to CDDB:

```shell
$ jack --submit
```

Use to save frequently uses options to your `~/.jack3rc` configuration file:

```shell
$ jack --encoder-name=flac --save
```


## Installation

### Requirements

* Right now only python-2.7 is supported - as found on Debian GNU/Linux 9.0 (stretch).
  See [this branch](https://github.com/jack-cli-cd-ripper/jack/tree/python3-mb) for a work-in-progress python 3 port
* CDDB.py  - see `doc/INSTALL` on how to get/install it
* eyeD3    - see `doc/INSTALL` on how to get/install it
* an encoder like oggenc for Ogg/Vorbis (default), flac (Free Lossless Audio
  Codec) or lame (MP3)
* a Digital Audio Extraction tool like cdparanoia

Read `doc/INSTALL` for further installation details. It's very unlikely that
it'll run out of the box, you need to install additional software.

## Freedb

Freedb servers are gone. For existing installations, [download this plugin](https://github.com/jack-cli-cd-ripper/jack/raw/master/plugins/jack_plugin_gnudb.py)
to ~/.jack.plugins/ (create directory). Then run
```shell
jack --server plugin_gnudb --save
```
